#14.4 Regression Line
mu_x <- mean(galton_heights$father)
mu_y <- mean(galton_heights$son)
s_x <- sd(galton_heights$father)
s_y <- sd(galton_heights$son)
r <- cor(galton_heights$father, galton_heights$son)

  ggplot(aes(father, son)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(slope = r * s_y/s_x, intercept = mu_y - r * s_y/s_x * mu_x) 

#the regression formula implies when standardizing the variables:
#subtracting the average and dividing the standard deviation, then
#regression line has intercept 0 and a slope equal to the correlation rho
#the plot above can then be input as the following:

  ggplot(aes(scale(father), scale(son))) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = r) 

#14.16 Exercises

#1. Load the GaltonFamilies data from the HistData. The children in 
#each family are listed by gender and then by height. Create a dataset 
#called galton_heights by picking a male and female at random.

#2. Make a scatterplot for heights between mothers and daughters, 
#mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, and fathers and sons.
